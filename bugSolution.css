.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* This is the key change */
}

.inner-element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Adjust for padding and border */
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*In this solution box-sizing: border-box; is used to make sure that the padding and border are included in the width calculation. This prevents the inner element from being smaller than expected.  Adjusting the calculation from `calc(100% - 10px)` to `calc(100% - 20px)` accounts for both the left and right 10px padding (or change this according to your needs).*/
