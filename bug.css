The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element has padding or border. The calculation is performed on the content box, and any padding or border will increase the parent element's total size.  This can lead to unexpected layout issues. Another common issue occurs when mixing units within the `calc()` function, for example, trying to subtract pixels from percentages directly, sometimes resulting in unexpected outcomes or errors.
